VOLODYA</h2>
<p class="nind"><span class="xhtml_big">A</span><small>T</small> five o'clock one Sunday afternoon in summer, Volodya, a plain, shy,
sickly-looking lad of seventeen, was sitting in the arbour of the
Shumihins' country villa, feeling dreary. His despondent thought flowed
in three directions. In the first place, he had next day, Monday, an
examination in mathematics; he knew that if he did not get through the
written examination on the morrow, he would be expelled, for he had
already been two years in the sixth form and had two and three-quarter
marks for algebra in his annual report. In the second place, his
presence at the villa of the Shumihins, a wealthy family with
aristocratic pretensions, was a continual source of mortification to his
<i>amour-propre</i>. It seemed to him that Madame Shumihin looked upon him
and his maman as poor relations and dependents, that they laughed at his
<i>maman</i> and did not respect her. He had on one occasion accidently
overheard Madame Shumihin, in the verandah, telling her cousin Anna
Fyodorovna that his <i>maman</i> still tried to look young and got herself
up, that she never paid her losses at cards, and had a partiality for
other people's shoes and tobacco. Every day Volodya besought his <i>maman</i>
not to go to the Shumihins', and drew a picture of the humiliating part
she played with these gentlefolk. He tried to persuade her, said rude
things, but she—a frivolous, pampered woman, who had run through two
fortunes, her own and her husband's, in her time, and always gravitated
towards acquaintances of high rank—did not understand him, and twice a
week Volodya had to accompany her to the villa he hated.</p>
<p>In the third place, the youth could not for one instant get rid of a
strange, unpleasant feeling which was absolutely new to him.... It
seemed to him that he was in love with Anna Fyodorovna, the Shumihins'
cousin, who was staying with them. She was a vivacious, loud-voiced,
laughter-loving, healthy, and vigorous lady of thirty, with rosy cheeks,
plump shoulders, a plump round chin and a continual smile on her thin
lips. She was neither young nor beautiful—Volodya knew that perfectly
well; but for some reason he could not help thinking of her, looking at
her while she shrugged her plump shoulders and moved her flat back as
she played croquet, or after prolonged laughter and running up and down
stairs, sank into a low chair, and, half closing her eyes and gasping
for breath, pretended that she was stifling and could not breathe. She
was married. Her husband, a staid and dignified architect, came once a
week to the villa, slept soundly, and returned to town. Volodya's
strange feeling had begun with his conceiving an unaccountable hatred
for the architect, and feeling relieved every time he went back to town.</p>
<p>Now, sitting in the arbour, thinking of his examination next day, and of
his <i>maman</i>, at whom they laughed, he felt an intense desire to see
Nyuta (that was what the Shumihins called Anna Fyodorovna), to hear her
laughter and the rustle of her dress.... This desire was not like the
pure, poetic love of which he read in novels and about which he dreamed
every night when he went to bed; it was strange, incomprehensible; he
was ashamed of it, and afraid of it as of something very wrong and
impure, something which it was disagreeable to confess even to himself.</p>
<p>"It's not love," he said to himself. "One can't fall in love with women
of thirty who are married. It is only a little intrigue.... Yes, an
intrigue...."</p>
<p>Pondering on the "intrigue," he thought of his uncontrollable shyness,
his lack of moustache, his freckles, his narrow eyes, and put himself in
his imagination side by side with Nyuta, and the juxtaposition seemed to
him impossible; then he made haste to imagine himself bold, handsome,
witty, dressed in the latest fashion.</p>
<p>When his dreams were at their height, as he sat huddled together and
looking at the ground in a dark corner of the arbour, he heard the sound
of light footsteps. Some one was coming slowly along the avenue. Soon
the steps stopped and something white gleamed in the entrance.</p>
<p>"Is there any one here?" asked a woman's voice.</p>
<p>Volodya recognised the voice, and raised his head in a fright.</p>
<p>"Who is here?" asked Nyuta, going into the arbour. "Ah, it is you,
Volodya? What are you doing here? Thinking? And how can you go on
thinking, thinking, thinking?... That's the way to go out of your mind!"</p>
<p>Volodya got up and looked in a dazed way at Nyuta. She had only just
come back from bathing. Over her shoulder there was hanging a sheet and
a rough towel, and from under the white silk kerchief on her head he
could see the wet hair sticking to her forehead. There was the cool damp
smell of the bath-house and of almond soap still hanging about her. She
was out of breath from running quickly. The top button of her blouse was
undone, so that the boy saw her throat and bosom.</p>
<p>"Why don't you say something?" said Nyuta, looking Volodya up and down.
"It's not polite to be silent when a lady talks to you. What a clumsy
seal you are though, Volodya! You always sit, saying nothing, thinking
like some philosopher. There's not a spark of life or fire in you! You
are really horrid!... At your age you ought to be living, skipping, and
jumping, chattering, flirting, falling in love."</p>
<p>Volodya looked at the sheet that was held by a plump white hand, and
thought....</p>
<p>"He's mute," said Nyuta, with wonder; "it is strange, really.... Listen!
Be a man! Come, you might smile at least! Phew, the horrid philosopher!"
she laughed. "But do you know, Volodya, why you are such a clumsy seal?
Because you don't devote yourself to the ladies. Why don't you? It's
true there are no girls here, but there is nothing to prevent your
flirting with the married ladies! Why don't you flirt with me, for
instance?"</p>
<p>Volodya listened and scratched his forehead in acute and painful
irresolution.</p>
<p>"It's only very proud people who are silent and love solitude," Nyuta
went on, pulling his hand away from his forehead. "You are proud,
Volodya. Why do you look at me like that from under your brows? Look me
straight in the face, if you please! Yes, now then, clumsy seal!"</p>
<p>Volodya made up his mind to speak. Wanting to smile, he twitched his
lower lip, blinked, and again put his hand to his forehead.</p>
<p>"I ... I love you," he said.</p>
<p>Nyuta raised her eyebrows in surprise, and laughed.</p>
<p>"What do I hear?" she sang, as prima-donnas sing at the opera when they
hear something awful. "What? What did you say? Say it again, say it
again...."</p>
<p>"I ... I love you!" repeated Volodya.</p>
<p>And without his will's having any part in his action, without reflection
or understanding, he took half a step towards Nyuta and clutched her by
the arm. Everything was dark before his eyes, and tears came into them.
The whole world was turned into one big, rough towel which smelt of the
bathhouse.</p>
<p>"Bravo, bravo!" he heard a merry laugh. "Why don't you speak? I want you
to speak! Well?"</p>
<p>Seeing that he was not prevented from holding her arm, Volodya glanced
at Nyuta's laughing face, and clumsily, awkwardly, put both arms round
her waist, his hands meeting behind her back. He held her round the
waist with both arms, while, putting her hands up to her head, showing
the dimples in her elbows, she set her hair straight under the kerchief
and said in a calm voice:</p>
<p>"You must be tactful, polite, charming, and you can only become that
under feminine influence. But what a wicked, angry face you have! You
must talk, laugh.... Yes, Volodya, don't be surly; you are young and
will have plenty of time for philosophising. Come, let go of me; I am
going. Let go."</p>
<p>Without effort she released her waist, and, humming something, walked
out of the arbour. Volodya was left alone. He smoothed his hair, smiled,
and walked three times to and fro across the arbour, then he sat down on
the bench and smiled again. He felt insufferably ashamed, so much so
that he wondered that human shame could reach such a pitch of acuteness
and intensity. Shame made him smile, gesticulate, and whisper some
disconnected words.</p>
<p>He was ashamed that he had been treated like a small boy, ashamed of his
shyness, and, most of all, that he had had the audacity to put his arms
round the waist of a respectable married woman, though, as it seemed to
him, he had neither through age nor by external quality, nor by social
position any right to do so.</p>
<p>He jumped up, went out of the arbour, and, without looking round, walked
into the recesses of the garden furthest from the house.</p>
<p>"Ah! only to get away from here as soon as possible," he thought,
clutching his head. "My God! as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The train by which Volodya was to go back with his <i>maman</i> was at
eight-forty. There were three hours before the train started, but he
would with pleasure have gone to the station at once without waiting for
his <i>maman</i>.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock he went to the house. His whole figure was expressive
of determination: what would be, would be! He made up his mind to go in
boldly, to look them straight in the face, to speak in a loud voice,
regardless of everything.</p>
<p>He crossed the terrace, the big hall and the drawing-room, and there
stopped to take breath. He could hear them in the dining-room, drinking
tea. Madame Shumihin, <i>maman</i>, and Nyuta were talking and laughing about
something.</p>
<p>Volodya listened.</p>
<p>"I assure you!" said Nyuta. "I could not believe my eyes! When he began
declaring his passion and—just imagine!—put his arms round my waist, I
should not have recognised him. And you know he has a way with him! When
he told me he was in love with me, there was something brutal in his
face, like a Circassian."</p>
<p>"Really!" gasped <i>maman</i>, going off into a peal of laughter. "Really!
How he does remind me of his father!"</p>
<p>Volodya ran back and dashed out into the open air.</p>
<p>"How could they talk of it aloud!" he wondered in agony, clasping his
hands and looking up to the sky in horror. "They talk aloud in cold
blood ... and <i>maman</i> laughed!... <i>Maman!</i> My God, why didst Thou give
me such a mother? Why?"</p>
<p>But he had to go to the house, come what might. He walked three times up
and down the avenue, grew a little calmer, and went into the house.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you come in in time for tea?" Madame Shumihin asked sternly.</p>
<p>"I am sorry, it's ... it's time for me to go," he muttered, not raising
his eyes. "<i>Maman</i>, it's eight o'clock!"</p>
<p>"You go alone, my dear," said his <i>maman</i> languidly. "I am staying the
night with Lili. Goodbye, my dear.... Let me make the sign of the cross
over you."</p>
<p>She made the sign of the cross over her son, and said in French, turning
to Nyuta:</p>
<p>"He's rather like Lermontov ... isn't he?"</p>
<p>Saying good-bye after a fashion, without looking any one in the face,
Volodya went out of the dining-room. Ten minutes later he was walking
along the road to the station, and was glad of it. Now he felt neither
frightened nor ashamed; he breathed freely and easily.</p>
<p>About half a mile from the station, he sat down on a stone by the side
of the road, and gazed at the sun, which was half hidden behind a
barrow. There were lights already here and there at the station, and one
green light glimmered dimly, but the train was not yet in sight. It was
pleasant to Volodya to sit still without moving, and to watch the
evening coming little by little. The darkness of the arbour, the
footsteps, the smell of the bath-house, the laughter, and the waist—all
these rose with amazing vividness before his imagination, and all this
was no longer so terrible and important as before.</p>
<p>"It's of no consequence.... She did not pull her hand away, and laughed
when I held her by the waist," he thought. "So she must have liked it.
If she had disliked it she would have been angry...."</p>
<p>And now Volodya felt sorry that he had not had more boldness there in
the arbour. He felt sorry that he was so stupidly going away, and he was
by now persuaded that if the same thing happened again he would be
bolder and look at it more simply.</p>
<p>And it would not be difficult for the opportunity to occur again. They
used to stroll about for a long time after supper at the Shumihins'. If
Volodya went for a walk with Nyuta in the dark garden, there would be an
opportunity!</p>
<p>"I will go back," he thought, "and will go by the morning train
to-morrow.... I will say I have missed the train."</p>
<p>And he turned back.... Madame Shumihin, <i>Maman</i>, Nyuta, and one of the
nieces were sitting on the verandah, playing <i>vint</i>. When Volodya told
them the lie that he had missed the train, they were uneasy that he
might be late for the examination day, and advised him to get up early.
All the while they were playing he sat on one side, greedily watching
Nyuta and waiting.... He already had a plan prepared in his mind: he
would go up to Nyuta in the dark, would take her by the hand, then would
embrace her; there would be no need to say anything, as both of them
would understand without words.</p>
<p>But after supper the ladies did not go for a walk in the garden, but
went on playing cards. They played till one o'clock at night, and then
broke up to go to bed.</p>
<p>"How stupid it all is!" Volodya thought with vexation as he got into
bed. "But never mind; I'll wait till to-morrow ... to-morrow in the
arbour. It doesn't matter...."</p>
<p>He did not attempt to go to sleep, but sat in bed, hugging his knees and
thinking. All thought of the examination was hateful to him. He had
already made up his mind that they would expel him, and that there was
nothing terrible about his being expelled. On the contrary, it was a
good thing—a very good thing, in fact. Next day he would be as free as
a bird; he would put on ordinary clothes instead of his school uniform,
would smoke openly, come out here, and make love to Nyuta when he liked;
and he would not be a schoolboy but "a young man." And as for the rest
of it, what is called a career, a future, that was clear; Volodya would
go into the army or the telegraph service, or he would go into a
chemist's shop and work his way up till he was a dispenser.... There
were lots of callings. An hour or two passed, and he was still sitting
and thinking....</p>
<p>Towards three o'clock, when it was beginning to get light, the door
creaked cautiously and his <i>maman</i> came into the room.</p>
<p>"Aren't you asleep?" she asked, yawning. "Go to sleep; I have only come
in for a minute.... I am only fetching the drops...."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Poor Lili has got spasms again. Go to sleep, my child, your
examination's to-morrow...."</p>
<p>She took a bottle of something out of the cupboard, went to the window,
read the label, and went away.</p>
<p>"Marya Leontyevna, those are not the drops!" Volodya heard a woman's
voice, a minute later. "That's convallaria, and Lili wants morphine. Is
your son asleep? Ask him to look for it...."</p>
<p>It was Nyuta's voice. Volodya turned cold. He hurriedly put on his
trousers, flung his coat over his shoulders, and went to the door.</p>
<p>"Do you understand? Morphine," Nyuta explained in a whisper. "There must
be a label in Latin. Wake Volodya; he will find it."</p>
<p><i>Maman</i> opened the door and Volodya caught sight of Nyuta. She was
wearing the same loose wrapper in which she had gone to bathe. Her hair
hung loose and disordered on her shoulders, her face looked sleepy and
dark in the half-light....</p>
<p>"Why, Volodya is not asleep," she said. "Volodya, look in the cupboard
for the morphine, there's a dear! What a nuisance Lili is! She has
always something the matter."</p>
<p><i>Maman</i> muttered something, yawned, and went away.</p>
<p>"Look for it," said Nyuta. "Why are you standing still?"</p>
<p>Volodya went to the cupboard, knelt down, and began looking through the
bottles and boxes of medicine. His hands were trembling, and he had a
feeling in his chest and stomach as though cold waves were running all
over his inside. He felt suffocated and giddy from the smell of ether,
carbolic acid, and various drugs, which he quite unnecessarily snatched
up with his trembling fingers and spilled in so doing.</p>
<p>"I believe <i>maman</i> has gone," he thought. "That's a good thing ... a
good thing...."</p>
<p>"Will you be quick?" said Nyuta, drawling.</p>
<p>"In a minute.... Here, I believe this is morphine," said Volodya,
reading on one of the labels the word "morph...." "Here it is!"</p>
<p>Nyuta was standing in the doorway in such a way that one foot was in his
room and one was in the passage. She was tidying her hair, which was
difficult to put in order because it was so thick and long, and looked
absent-mindedly at Volodya. In her loose wrap, with her sleepy face and
her hair down, in the dim light that came into the white sky not yet lit
by the sun, she seemed to Volodya captivating, magnificent....
Fascinated, trembling all over, and remembering with relish how he had
held that exquisite body in his arms in the arbour, he handed her the
bottle and said:</p>
<p>"How wonderful you are!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>She came into the room.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked, smiling.</p>
<p>He was silent and looked at her, then, just as in the arbour, he took
her hand, and she looked at him with a smile and waited for what would
happen next.</p>
<p>"I love you," he whispered.</p>
<p>She left off smiling, thought a minute, and said:</p>
<p>"Wait a little; I think somebody is coming. Oh, these schoolboys!" she
said in an undertone, going to the door and peeping out into the
passage. "No, there is no one to be seen...."</p>
<p>She came back.</p>
<p>Then it seemed to Volodya that the room, Nyuta, the sunrise and
himself—all melted together in one sensation of acute, extraordinary,
incredible bliss, for which one might give up one's whole life and face
eternal torments.... But half a minute passed and all that vanished.
Volodya saw only a fat, plain face, distorted by an expression of
repulsion, and he himself suddenly felt a loathing for what had
happened.</p>
<p>"I must go away, though," said Nyuta, looking at Volodya with disgust.
"What a wretched, ugly ... fie, ugly duckling!"</p>
<p>How unseemly her long hair, her loose wrap, her steps, her voice seemed
to Volodya now!...</p>
<p>"'Ugly duckling' ..." he thought after she had gone away. "I really am
ugly ... everything is ugly."</p>
<p>The sun was rising, the birds were singing loudly; he could hear the
gardener walking in the garden and the creaking of his wheelbarrow ...
and soon afterwards he heard the lowing of the cows and the sounds of
the shepherd's pipe. The sunlight and the sounds told him that somewhere
in this world there is a pure, refined, poetical life. But where was it?
Volodya had never heard a word of it from his <i>maman</i> or any of the
people round about him.</p>
<p>When the footman came to wake him for the morning train, he pretended to
be asleep....</p>
<p>"Bother it! Damn it all!" he thought.</p>
<p>He got up between ten and eleven.</p>
<p>Combing his hair before the looking-glass, and looking at his ugly face,
pale from his sleepless night, he thought:</p>
<p>"It's perfectly true ... an ugly duckling!"</p>
<p>When <i>maman</i> saw him and was horrified that he was not at his
examination, Volodya said:</p>
<p>"I overslept myself, <i>maman</i>.... But don't worry, I will get a medical
certificate."</p>
<p>Madame Shumihin and Nyuta waked up at one o'clock. Volodya heard Madame
Shumihin open her window with a bang, heard Nyuta go off into a peal of
laughter in reply to her coarse voice. He saw the door open and a string
of nieces and other toadies (among the latter was his <i>maman</i>) file into
lunch, caught a glimpse of Nyuta's freshly washed laughing face, and,
beside her, the black brows and beard of her husband the architect, who
had just arrived.</p>
<p>Nyuta was wearing a Little Russian dress which did not suit her at all,
and made her look clumsy; the architect was making dull and vulgar
jokes. The rissoles served at lunch had too much onion in them—so it
seemed to Volodya. It also seemed to him that Nyuta laughed loudly on
purpose, and kept glancing in his direction to give him to understand
that the memory of the night did not trouble her in the least, and that
she was not aware of the presence at table of the "ugly duckling."</p>
<p>At four o'clock Volodya drove to the station with his <i>maman</i>. Foul
memories, the sleepless night, the prospect of expulsion from school,
the stings of conscience—all roused in him now an oppressive, gloomy
anger. He looked at <i>maman</i>'s sharp profile, at her little nose, and at
the raincoat which was a present from Nyuta, and muttered:</p>
<p>"Why do you powder? It's not becoming at your age! You make yourself up,
don't pay your debts at cards, smoke other people's tobacco.... It's
hateful! I don't love you ... I don't love you!"</p>
<p>He was insulting her, and she moved her little eyes about in alarm,
flung up her hands, and whispered in horror:</p>
<p>"What are you saying, my dear! Good gracious! the coachman will hear! Be
quiet or the coachman will hear! He can overhear everything."</p>
<p>"I don't love you ... I don't love you!" he went on breathlessly.
"You've no soul and no morals.... Don't dare to wear that raincoat! Do
you hear? Or else I will tear it into rags...."</p>
<p>"Control yourself, my child," <i>maman</i> wept; "the coachman can hear!"</p>
<p>"And where is my father's fortune? Where is your money? You have wasted
it all. I am not ashamed of being poor, but I am ashamed of having such
a mother.... When my schoolfellows ask questions about you, I always
blush."</p>
<p>In the train they had to pass two stations before they reached the town.
Volodya spent all the time on the little platform between two carriages
and shivered all over. He did not want to go into the compartment
because there the mother he hated was sitting. He hated himself, hated
the ticket collectors, the smoke from the engine, the cold to which he
attributed his shivering. And the heavier the weight on his heart, the
more strongly he felt that somewhere in the world, among some people,
there was a pure, honourable, warm, refined life, full of love,
affection, gaiety, and serenity.... He felt this and was so intensely
miserable that one of the passengers, after looking in his face
attentively, actually asked:</p>
<p>"You have the toothache, I suppose?"</p>
<p>In the town <i>maman</i> and Volodya lived with Marya Petrovna, a lady of
noble rank, who had a large flat and let rooms to boarders. <i>Maman</i> had
two rooms, one with windows and two pictures in gold frames hanging on
the walls, in which her bed stood and in which she lived, and a little
dark room opening out of it in which Volodya lived. Here there was a
sofa on which he slept, and, except that sofa, there was no other
furniture; the rest of the room was entirely filled up with wicker
baskets full of clothes, cardboard hat-boxes, and all sorts of rubbish,
which <i>maman</i> preserved for some reason or other. Volodya prepared his
lessons either in his mother's room or in the "general room," as the
large room in which the boarders assembled at dinner-time and in the
evening was called.</p>
<p>On reaching home he lay down on his sofa and put the quilt over him to
stop his shivering. The cardboard hat-boxes, the wicker baskets, and the
other rubbish, reminded him that he had not a room of his own, that he
had no refuge in which he could get away from his mother, from her
visitors, and from the voices that were floating up from the "general
room." The satchel and the books lying about in the corners reminded him
of the examination he had missed.... For some reason there came into his
mind, quite inappropriately, Mentone, where he had lived with his father
when he was seven years old; he thought of Biarritz and two little
English girls with whom he ran about on the sand.... He tried to recall
to his memory the colour of the sky, the sea, the height of the waves,
and his mood at the time, but he could not succeed. The English girls
flitted before his imagination as though they were living; all the rest
was a medley of images that floated away in confusion....</p>
<p>"No; it's cold here," thought Volodya. He got up, put on his overcoat,
and went into the "general room."</p>
<p>There they were drinking tea. There were three people at the samovar:
<i>maman</i>; an old lady with tortoiseshell pince-nez, who gave music
lessons; and Avgustin Mihalitch, an elderly and very stout Frenchman,
who was employed at a perfumery factory.</p>
<p>"I have had no dinner to-day," said <i>maman</i>. "I ought to send the maid
to buy some bread."</p>
<p>"Dunyasha!" shouted the Frenchman.</p>
<p>It appeared that the maid had been sent out somewhere by the lady of the
house.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's of no consequence," said the Frenchman, with a broad smile.
"I will go for some bread myself at once. Oh, it's nothing."</p>
<p>He laid his strong, pungent cigar in a conspicuous place, put on his hat
and went out. After he had gone away <i>maman</i> began telling the music
teacher how she had been staying at the Shumihins', and how warmly they
welcomed her.</p>
<p>"Lili Shumihin is a relation of mine, you know," she said. "Her late
husband, General Shumihin, was a cousin of my husband. And she was a
Baroness Kolb by birth...."</p>
<p>"<i>Maman</i>, that's false!" said Volodya irritably. "Why tell lies?"</p>
<p>He knew perfectly well that what his mother said was true; in what she
was saying about General Shumihin and about Baroness Kolb there was not
a word of lying, but nevertheless he felt that she was lying. There was
a suggestion of falsehood in her manner of speaking, in the expression
of her face, in her eyes, in everything.</p>
<p>"You are lying," repeated Volodya; and he brought his fist down on the
table with such force that all the crockery shook and <i>maman</i>'s tea was
spilt over. "Why do you talk about generals and baronesses? It's all
lies!"</p>
<p>The music teacher was disconcerted, and coughed into her handkerchief,
affecting to sneeze, and <i>maman</i> began to cry.</p>
<p>"Where can I go?" thought Volodya.</p>
<p>He had been in the street already; he was ashamed to go to his
schoolfellows. Again, quite incongruously, he remembered the two little
English girls.... He paced up and down the "general room," and went into
Avgustin Mihalitch's room. Here there was a strong smell of ethereal
oils and glycerine soap. On the table, in the window, and even on the
chairs, there were a number of bottles, glasses, and wineglasses
containing fluids of various colours. Volodya took up from the table a
newspaper, opened it and read the title <i>Figaro</i> ... There was a strong
and pleasant scent about the paper. Then he took a revolver from the
table....</p>
<p>"There, there! Don't take any notice of it." The music teacher was
comforting <i>maman</i> in the next room. "He is young! Young people of his
age never restrain themselves. One must resign oneself to that."</p>
<p>"No, Yevgenya Andreyevna; he's too spoilt," said <i>maman</i> in a singsong
voice. "He has no one in authority over him, and I am weak and can do
nothing. Oh, I am unhappy!"</p>
<p>Volodya put the muzzle of the revolver to his mouth, felt something like
a trigger or spring, and pressed it with his finger.... Then felt
something else projecting, and once more pressed it. Taking the muzzle
out of his mouth, he wiped it with the lapel of his coat, looked at the
lock. He had never in his life taken a weapon in his hand before....</p>
<p>"I believe one ought to raise this ..." he reflected. "Yes, it seems
so."</p>
<p>Avgustin Mihalitch went into the "general room," and with a laugh began
telling them about something. Volodya put the muzzle in his mouth again,
pressed it with his teeth, and pressed something with his fingers. There
was a sound of a shot.... Something hit Volodya in the back of his head
with terrible violence, and he fell on the table with his face downwards
among the bottles and glasses. Then he saw his father, as in Mentone, in
a top-hat with a wide black band on it, wearing mourning for some lady,
suddenly seize him by both hands, and they fell headlong into a very
deep, dark pit.</p>
<p>Then everything was blurred and vanished.</p>
